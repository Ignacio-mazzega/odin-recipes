    <h2>Classic biscuits</h2>
    <p>Buttery, flaky, dramatically layered, these classic biscuits are a work of art, but they can be intimidating—and who wants a biscuit that falls flat? These recipes and expert tips from biscuit king Chadwick Boyd ensure you can’t miss.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>    
            
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>    
            
        <li>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</li>    
            
        <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) very cold butter</li>    
            
        <li>3/4 cup full-fat Greek-style yogurt</li>    
            
        <li>1/2 cup very cold water</li>    
            
        <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and fine sea salt in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Coat whole stick of butter in flour mixture. Grate butter on the large holes of a box grater into bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together yogurt and water in a small bowl; add to flour mixture. Gently fold to bring dough together. </li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly knead three or four times until dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Press a 2 1/2- to 3-inch biscuit cutter straight down into dough to cut out biscuits. </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven  until tops are crisp and golden brown, 15 to 16 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
